## Trees (What Are They?)
Trees are another way to store data. There is the root (top of tree) and then there are branches.  
The start of each branch is called the 'parent.' The next set of data is called the 'child.'  
When data is insert into the tree, they are insert into a node that is part of the tree.  
Data is automatically sorted and placed into the tree based on the value of the parent.

## Example Problems
- basic overview of tree functions
- Finding and replacing value (resetting tree if needed)

## First Problem
- Adding to trees
- Removing from tree
- Finding value

## Find/Replace Value
- finding value (what is performance?)
- Replacing value (setting new values and references)
- Resetting tree to fix up size of tree

## Possible Problems
- Talking about recursion
- Problems may be too simple
- Creating code content
