# What are trees
- Outline of how trees look
- BST and associated functions
- Recap on recursion
- Performance of trees

## Example Problems
- basic overview of tree functions
- Finding and replacing value (resetting tree if needed)

## First Problem
- Adding to trees
- Removing from tree
- Finding value

## Find/Replace Value
- finding value (what is performance?)
- Replacing value (setting new values and references)
- Resetting tree to fix up size of tree

## Possible Problems
- Talking about recursion
- Problems may be too simple
- Creating code content
