# Welcome to Data Structs
This is a tutorial made by Nicholas Cable, on Nov. 16, 2020.
This will help people understand Python Data Structures through a series of readings and practice problems.

 - [Queues]
    1. How is it organized/data stored
        * Stored in a list
        * For problems, store class inside another class (easier to work with)
    2. FIFO
        * First in First out
        * remove from beginning of list instead of end
        * Priorities?
    3. Sample problems
        * Adding/Removing from list
            1. How to add to a queue (insert and not append [tell difference between the two])
            2. How to remove from a queue (dequeue)
        * Class registration
            1. How many spots in class?
            2. Who signed up first? (could just use index to find that)
            3. What happens when someone drops the class?

 - [Linked Lists]
    - Design of linked list (include image)
    - How does it link to each other
        * Each item is a node
        * Next and prev links
    - How does it save memory (uses space in memory instead of array of data)
        * place in memory to store data
        * how to access the data
    - When to use it
    - performance
        * O(n) perfomance
        * Run through list using 'yield' to get each point
    - Possible Sample Problems
        * Problem 1
            1. Creating linked list
            2. Looping through linked list
            3. Getting sum of all values of list
        * Problem 2
            1. 

 - [Trees]
    * What does a tree look like?
        1. Looks like a literal tree (with branches)
        2. Add a diagram with more details
    * How is data stored
        1. Unbalanced tree (add image here)
        2. Balanced tree (add image here)
        3. Function to balance tree
    * Perfomance of a tree
        1. log(n) performance
        2. Functions to run through tree
        3. Recursion!
    * Possible sample problems
        1. Adding values to a tree. Removing values? 
        2. Balancing tree?


These three topics will be covered in this repository.
