# Queues in Python
Created November 16, 2020

## Define 
- a queue
- performance of a queue
- how to implement queues
- FIFO

## Two problems completed and made by me (first one needs to be completely solved and solution displayed)
- how to add to a queue
- removing from a queue

## real life example of queue for registering for classes
- input people who sign up for class
- register their id
- date they sign up for class

Possible problems:
1. creating the classes to store student information
2. what happens if the class is full?

Is there anything else to write about?
